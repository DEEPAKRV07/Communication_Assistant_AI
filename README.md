# AI-Powered Communication Assistant

A simple end-to-end demo that ingests emails (via CSV or IMAP), filters for support-related messages,
extracts key info, prioritizes by urgency, analyzes sentiment, retrieves context from a local KB (RAG),
and generates draft responses. Includes a Streamlit dashboard for review and sending replies.

## Quick Start (Local Demo)
1) Create and activate a virtual environment (optional).
2) Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3) Run the dashboard:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
4) In the app, upload the provided sample CSV (or your own), or connect to IMAP in the sidebar.

## IMAP/Gmail/Outlook (Optional)
- In the sidebar, provide IMAP host (e.g., imap.gmail.com), port (usually 993), email, and app password.
- Click "Fetch Emails". For Gmail, you may need an app password or OAuth; for Outlook, consider Microsoft Graph API.

## RAG (Local Knowledge Base)
- Place your markdown files in `kb/`. The app builds a TFâ€‘IDF index to retrieve the top snippets for context.
- Edit `kb/getting_started.md` and `kb/shipping_and_returns.md` as examples.

## Notes
- Sentiment and urgency are rule-based for offline use.
- SMTP sending is supported via settings in the sidebar (host, port, username, password). Use with care.
